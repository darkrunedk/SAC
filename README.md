#Discontinued
Due to changes made by Valve/Steam, resulting in the API no longer working means the project is not discontinued.

# SAC
SAC or Steam Achievement Checker is a website that displays the remaining achevements, that a User still needs to achieve. Not all games works with SAC but some do.

# Where can I find the website?

The website can be visited here: [SAC Homepage](http://www.sac.darkrune.dk/)

# How do I use SAC?

You need to either write the users id or custom url. A custom url can be made under Edit profile â†’ Custom Url. The profile id of a steam user can be found at the url.

An example could be http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/SOME NUMBERS/ where the part containing SOME NUMBERS would be the user id.

You will also need the game's id, which can be found in the url on the game's page in Steam. It the part of the url that is purely numbers.

An example could be http://store.steampowered.com/app/252950/Rocket_League/, which is Rocket League. The game's id would be 252950.
